CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) are designed to differentiate humans from automated bots. They serve as a security measure to prevent spam and automated extraction of data from websites. However, there are legitimate scenarios where automating CAPTCHA recognition is necessary, such as improving accessibility for visually impaired users or streamlining user testing environments.

The CAPTCHA Recognizer System is a machine learning project aimed at developing an automated solution to recognize and interpret CAPTCHAs. The model uses advanced image processing techniques and deep learning algorithms to accurately decipher the text within CAPTCHA images.
